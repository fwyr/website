# \>\> rejoice!

I'm Weiyi, a former student of Dunman High School. 

I'm interested in the fields of physics and computer science. Previously, I've participated in several competitions that deal with cybersecurity, machine learning, and competitive programming. You can also look at [some pet research papers](./projects) that I worked on during my free time.

Other than that, I try my best to participate in puzzle hunts, read more books, and code fun things.

Thanks for visiting my site!
